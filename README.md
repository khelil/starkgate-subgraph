# StarkGate Subgraph 

StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized ZK-Rollup. It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation â€“ without compromising Ethereum's composability and security.

StarkGate serves as a gateway between Ethereum and StarkNet, and allows users to do everything they can expect from a bridge.

The bridge is deployed on [Testnet](https://goerli.starkgate.starknet.io/) and [Mainnet](https://starkgate.starknet.io/).
